# Ordering Guide

Follow [this](./gerber.zip) link to download the gerber zip file located in the /production folder.

Follow [this](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote) link to go to the upload of Gerber Files at jlcpcb.

When the gerbers are uploaded, you should see this:

Choose the decired **pcb quantity**. Minimum quantity is 5.

Leave all the other choices at their default, and scroll to the bottom of the page:
![image](https://github.com/nordstream3/FOC/assets/129880401/dfb52719-19e5-4a74-8983-317298adc47c)

Select "Free Assembly for your PCB order".

Again, you need to specify the how many of you ordered pcbs you would like to be pre-assembled with components.

Leave the remaining choices at their defaults and scroll to the bottom of the page and click "Confirm".

## Process BOM & CPL

After your confirmation, you will be presented with a kind of Wizard, with the first page showing a top view of the pcb.

Click "Next" to go to the relevant page for upload of BOM and CPL files.

Follow [this](./bom.csv) link to download the BOM located in the /production folder.  
Follow [this](./foc_cpl_top.csv) link to download the CPL located in the /production folder.

When you have successfully uploaded the BOM and CPL click on "Process BOM & CPL", whereafter you will be presented with an "ERROR".

Which is in fact not an error, but a notice that there is a mismatch between BOM and CPL, since the CPL only contains coordinates of components on the **top side** of the pcb. 

Importantly, you should click on "Continue", and you will presented with a **long** list of all the components matched in the BOM & CPL.

Scroll down the list to find if there are any components that fall short:

> This is just an example! There might not necessarily be any shortfalls.  
> FOC_KING is optimized for lowest jlcpcb price. Where possible, **basic library** is always first choice.  
> Basic Library: These are the components pre-loaded in the SMD Automatic Pick and Place Machine.  
> Extended Library: These are the components requiring manual setup, and you will be charged an extra fee per component type.

After you have found replacements for any shortfall components, you should scroll to find the "Connector_PinHeader_2.54mm footprints:
![image](https://github.com/nordstream3/FOC/assets/129880401/5552c263-93cb-4ac6-b863-2c156b197f62)

Importantly, you must **deselect** all 2.54mm pin headers.

When this is done, choose "Next", and you will be presented with a dialog:

Select "Do not place".

## Fix component rotational misalignments

You should now be presented with a rough render of the smd layout, where you need to fix a few issues by using the "rotate left" and "rotate right" buttons in the top menu.

These might be issues (but there could potentially be more):

## Overview of fixed smd layout

When the alignment issues are solved, the rendered smd layout should look something like this:

Click on "Save to cart".

Your order is now added to your Shopping Cart, and you should **proceed to payment**.

## Remember to order the remaining components that you need to manually solder
* Mosfet
* 2 680uF Capacitors
* 4 1x20 Machine header pins
* JST Connectors
* etc.

These components are listed in the [Assembly Guide](https://github.com/nordstream3/FOC/edit/main/production) with LCSC part numbers and AliExpress links.
